## üìù Comments in Java

**Comments** are **non-executable lines** in Java code meant for **documentation, explanation, or disabling code** during testing. The compiler **ignores** them.

---

### 1. **Single-Line Comment (`//`)**

* Starts with `//`
* Used for short explanations or quick notes

‚úÖ **Example:**

```java
int age = 20; // This stores the user's age
```

---

### 2. **Multi-Line Comment (`/* ... */`)**

* Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`
* Used for block comments, usually over multiple lines

‚úÖ **Example:**

```java
/* This is a multi-line comment
   explaining the purpose of the following code block */
int sum = a + b;
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Using Comments

* Use comments to **explain why**, not what
  *(The code tells what it does, comments explain why it does that)*
* Keep them **short and meaningful**
* Avoid **over-commenting** obvious code
* Use Javadoc for **API-level documentation**
